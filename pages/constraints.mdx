These are some constraints of our platfor. we are continually evolving our [public roadmap](/roadmap) to meet the needs of our users, so if there is a feature here you need please let us know by either:
- commenting on an existing [roadmap](/roadmap) item telling us why it will be useful to your service
- submitting a new roadmap on our [public roadmap](/roadmap) 

## Autoscaling

The platform does not support autoscaling of tenant applications 'out of the box'. However tenants are able to automate the scaling of their applications by using the command line interface or API.

See issue [#17 on our public roadmap](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-roadmap/projects/1#card-26015204)

## Continuous Integration

The platform does not come with a CI/CD service but you are able to use industry standard tooling for this. [Read about how you can configure your own CI tooling to work with GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/using_ci.html#configuring-a-continuous-integration-ci-tool).

## Docker registry

The platform does not provide a Docker registry for hosting of images. 

Images must be pushed to a Docker registry such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) or [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry) before they can be deployed to GOV.UK PaaS. Your ability to stage and restage Docker applications is tied to the availability of the registry hosting the images.

## Functions as a service

GOV.UK PaaS does not currently support the Functions as a Service programming model.

## Graphics processing unit (GPU) support

Some machine learning workloads require the use of specific Amazon machine instance types that support hardware Graphics processing units (GPUs).

GOV.UK PaaS does not support GPUs.

## Identity provider

GOV.UK PaaS does not provide an identity provider for use in tenant applications.

## Public Service Network (PSN)

The platform does not support connection to the [Public Services Network](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/public-services-network).

## Virtual machines

We do not offer hosting for virtual machines.

## Windows

GOV.UK PaaS runs on an Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 linux kernel and does not runtime support for Windows binaries.

You may deploy [.NET Core](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/dotnet-core/index.html) applications via a buildpack.
